# Modular Energy Planning and Operations (MEPO) model
A GAMS/CPLEX model for generation planning, unit commitment, and production cost modeling. 

## Unique features: 
 * Native support for clustered generator commitment (integer rather than binary) for very fast execution
 * Highly Configurable constraints. Can enable/disable indivdually at run time
 * Same operations model used in both production costing and simulation

## Getting Started
