#    No printf parameters
#
# Simple BASH script to run and time a series of GAMS jobs to compare the run
# time of binary vs clustered unit commitment both with and without capacity
# expansion decisions
#
# To actually submit the job use:
#   qsub SCRIPT_NAME

#  Version History
# Ver   Date       Time  Who            What

#   2  2011-10-08  21:00  bpalmintier   Implemented use of scratch space

#========= Setup Job Queue Parameters ==========
# IMPORTANT: The lines beginning #PBS set various queuing parameters, they are not simple comments
#
# name of submitted job, also name of output file unless specified
# The default job name is the name of this script, so here we surpress the job naming so
# we get unique names for all of our jobs
##PBS -N matlab_pbs
#
# Ask for all 1 node with 8 processors. this may or may not give
# exclusive access to a machine, but typically the queueing system will
# assign the 8 core machines first
#
# By requiring 20GB we ensure we get one of the machines with 24GB (or maybe a 12 core unit)
#PBS -l nodes=1:ppn=8,mem=20gb
#
# This option merges any error messages into output file
#PBS -j oe 
#
# Select the queue based on maximum run times. options are:
#    short    2hr
#    medium   8hr
#    long    24hr
#    xlong   48hr, extendable to 168hr using -l walltime= option below
#PBS -q long
# And up the run time to the maximum of a full week (168 hrs)
##PBS -l walltime=168:00:00
